Nael is an *early-stage* package for GNU Emacs providing a humble
major-mode for the [[https://lean-lang.org/][Lean]] programming-language and theorem-prover.

“Nael” is “Lean” reversed and ends in “el” as in Emacs-Lisp.

* Setup

1. [[https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html][Install Lean]].
2. Install Nael. For example, manually:
   1. Clone the Git repository.
      #+begin_src sh
      git clone https://codeberg.org/mekeor/nael.git ~/path/to/nael
      #+end_src
   2. Set up ~load-path~.
      #+begin_src elisp
      (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/nael")
      #+end_src
3. Load Nael.  (Nael does not autoload anything.)
   #+begin_src elisp
   (require 'nael)
   #+end_src
4. Optionally, configure Nael.
   #+begin_src elisp
   (defun my-nael-setup ()
     (interactive)
     ;; Enable Emacs' built-in `TeX' input-method.  Alternatively, you
     ;; could install the external `unicode-math-input' package and
     ;; use the `unicode-math' input-method.
     (set-input-method "TeX")
     ;; Enable Emacs' built-in LSP-client Eglot.
     (eglot-ensure))

   (add-hook 'nael-mode-hook #'my-nael-setup)

   ;; Nael buffer-locally sets `compile-command' to "lake build".
   (keymap-set nael-mode-map "C-c C-c" #'project-compile)

   ;; Find out how to type the character at point in the current
   ;; input-method.
   (keymap-set nael-mode-map "C-c C-k" #'quail-show-key)
   #+end_src

* History

1. /Microsoft Corp.®/ et al. developed [[https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode][lean4-mode]] based on [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]].
2. /Richard Copley/ developed a [[https://github.com/bustercopley/lean4-mode][fork]] based on Emacs' built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eglot/][Eglot]].
3. /Mekeor Melire/ developed Nael which strives to be more humble by
   relying on Emacs' built-in facilities, like Eglot, ElDoc and
   Project.

* Technical Comparison

- Nael does not depend on third-party lsp-mode.  Instead, you can
  optionally use Nael together with Emacs' built-in LSP-client Eglot.
- Nael does not introduce a special buffer for information on the
  current goal etc.  Instead, Nael introduces two ElDoc documentation
  functions which will show up in the usual ElDoc buffer.
- Nael does not offer any special mechanism to detect the current
  project.  Instead, it introduces Lakefiles as a Project root
  markers.
- Nael does not offer any command to build the current project.
  Instead, it buffer-locally sets the built-in ~compile-command~
  variable.
- Nael does not offer any special input-method.  Instead, you may use
  the built-in =TeX= input-method or the =unicode-math= from the
  external [[https://github.com/astoff/unicode-math-input.el][unicode-math-input]] package.

* Roadmap :noexport:

- For =PlainGoal=, consider accessing =:goals= array rather than
  =:rendered= string in order to render it more prettily in Emacs.
- Introduce some customizable user-options regarding how goals and
  term-goals are displayed in the ElDoc buffer and how they are
  echoed.
- Check if we need to handle LSP code-actions in a special way, just
  like upstream.
- Check if we should to disable =workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles= just
  like upstream.
- Check if it's okay for a package to modify the
  ~project-vc-extra-root-markers~ variable (or if it is rather meant
  to be modified by users only).
- Support fontification via semantic tokens from language server:
