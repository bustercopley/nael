Nael – A humble Emacs major-mode for Lean
*****************************************

Nael (https://codeberg.org/mekeor/nael) is an early-stage package for
GNU Emacs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) providing a humble,
minimalist and unobtrusive major-mode for the Lean
(https://lean-lang.org/) programming-language and theorem-prover, based
on Emacs' built-in LSP-client Eglot
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eglot/).

   “Nael” is “Lean” reversed and ends in “el” as in Emacs-Lisp.

1 Setup
*******

  1. Install Lean (https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html).
  2. Install Nael.
  3. Configure Nael:

     ;; Nael does not autoload anything.  You need to load it.
     (require 'nael)

     (defun my-nael-setup ()
       ;; Enable Emacs' built-in `TeX' input-method.
       (set-input-method "TeX")

       ;; Enable Eglot.  (`lsp-mode' is not supported.)
       (eglot-ensure)

       ;; When Nael is used with Eglot, it will add functions to
       ;; `eldoc-documentation-functions'.  Make sure ElDoc shows the
       ;; output of all these functions.
       (setq-local eldoc-documentation-strategy
         #'eldoc-documentation-compose))

     (add-hook 'nael-mode-hook #'my-nael-setup)

     ;; Nael buffer-locally sets `compile-command' to "lean build".
     (keymap-set nael-mode-map "C-c C-c" #'compile)

     ;; Find out how to type the character at point in the current
     ;; input-method.
     (keymap-set nael-mode-map "C-c C-k" #'quail-show-key)

2 History
*********

  1. _Microsoft Corporation (R)_ et al.  developed lean4-mode
     (https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode) based on
     lsp-mode (https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode).
  2. _Richard Copley_ developed a fork
     (https://github.com/bustercopley/lean4-mode) based on Emacs'
     built-in Eglot
     (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eglot/).
  3. _Mekeor Melire_ developed Nael.  It strives to be unobtrusive and
     minimalist by relying on Emacs' built-in facilities, like Eglot,
     ElDoc and Project.

3 Comparison
************

   • Nael does not depend on third-party lsp-mode.  Instead, you can use
     Nael together with Emacs' built-in LSP-client Eglot.
   • Nael does not offer anything like the ‘*Lean Goal*’ buffer
     (‘lean4-info’).  Instead, Nael introduces two ElDoc documentation
     functions (‘eldoc-documentation-functions’) (corresponding to
     Lean's ‘PlainTermGoal’ and ‘PlainGoal’ LSP methods) which will show
     up in the usual ElDoc buffer (‘*eldoc*’).
   • Nael does not offer any special mechanism to detect the current
     project.  Instead, it adds ‘lakefile.lean’ as a project root marker
     (‘project-vc-extra-root-markers’) for ‘project.el’.
   • Nael does not offer any command to build the current the current
     project.  Instead, it buffer-locally sets the ‘compile-command’
     variable so that you can simply call the ‘compile’ command.
   • Nael does not offer any input-method.  Instead, you are encouraged
     to use the built-in ‘TeX’ input-method.  Alternatively, you could
     use the unicode-math-input
     (https://github.com/astoff/unicode-math-input.el) package.
