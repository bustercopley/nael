Nael – Lean for Emacs
*********************

Nael is an early-stage package for GNU Emacs providing a minimal and
unobtrusive major-mode for the Lean programming-language and
theorem-prover based on Emacs' built-in LSP-client Eglot.

   “Nael” is “Lean” reversed and ends in “el” as in Emacs-Lisp.

1 Setup
*******

  1. Install Lean (https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html).
  2. Install Nael.
  3. Configure Nael:

     ;; Nael does not autoload anything.  You need to load it.
     (require 'nael)

     ;; Nael works without Eglot.  But for good developer experience, it's
     ;; recommended to enable Eglot.  (LSP-Mode is not supported.)
     (add-hook 'nael-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)

     ;; Nael does not provide any input-method.  It's recommended to enable
     ;; Emacs' built-in `TeX' input-method:
     (defun my-nael-input-method-tex () (set-input-method "TeX"))
     (add-hook 'nael-mode-hook #'my-nael-input-method-tex)

     ;; Recommended key bindings:
     (keymap-set nael-mode-map "C-c C-c" #'compile)
     (keymap-set nael-mode-map "C-c C-k" #'quail-show-key)

2 History
*********

  1. _Microsoft Corporation (R)_ et al.  developed lean4-mode
     (https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode) based on
     lsp-mode (https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode).
  2. _Richard Copley_ developed a fork
     (https://github.com/bustercopley/lean4-mode) based on Emacs'
     built-in Eglot
     (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eglot/).
  3. _Mekeor Melire_ developed Nael.  It strives to be unobtrusive and
     minimalist by relying Emacs' built-in facilities, like Eglot, ElDoc
     and Project.
