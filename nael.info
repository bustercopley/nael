Nael – A humble Emacs major-mode for Lean
*****************************************

Nael is a package for GNU Emacs providing a humble major-mode for the
Lean (https://lean-lang.org/) programming-language and theorem-prover.

   “Nael” is “Lean” reversed and ends in “el” as in Emacs-Lisp.

1 Usage
*******

  1. Install Lean (https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html).
  2. Install Nael.  For example, manually:
       1. Clone the Git repository.
               git clone https://codeberg.org/mekeor/nael.git ~/path/to/nael
       2. Set up ‘load-path’.
               (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/nael")
  3. Load Nael.  (Nael does not autoload anything.)
          (require 'nael)
  4. Optionally, configure Nael.
          (defun my-nael-setup ()
            (interactive)
            ;; Enable Emacs' built-in `TeX' input-method.  Alternatively, you
            ;; could install the external `unicode-math-input' package and
            ;; use the `unicode-math' input-method.
            (set-input-method "TeX")
            ;; Enable Emacs' built-in LSP-client Eglot.
            (eglot-ensure))

          (add-hook 'nael-mode-hook #'my-nael-setup)

          ;; Nael buffer-locally sets `compile-command' to "lake build".
          (keymap-set nael-mode-map "C-c C-c" #'project-compile)

          ;; Find out how to type the character at point in the current
          ;; input-method.
          (keymap-set nael-mode-map "C-c C-k" #'quail-show-key)

2.1 Status
==========

Nael is actively maintained but still in rather early stage of
development.  Thus, it is not as fully featured as ‘lean4-mode’ and may
of course contain severe bugs.

3.1 History
===========

  1. _Microsoft Corp.®_ et al.  developed lean4-mode
     (https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode) based on
     lsp-mode (https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode).
  2. _Richard Copley_ developed a fork
     (https://github.com/bustercopley/lean4-mode) based on Emacs'
     built-in Eglot
     (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eglot/).
  3. _Mekeor Melire_ developed a fork based on Richard Copley's fork.
     It is called Nael and strives to be more humble by relying on
     Emacs' built-in facilities, like Eglot, ElDoc and Project.

3.2 Comparison
==============

   • Nael does not depend on third-party lsp-mode.  Instead, you can
     optionally use Nael together with Emacs' built-in LSP-client Eglot.
   • Nael does not offer any special buffer for information on the
     current goal etc.  Instead, Nael introduces two ElDoc documentation
     functions which will show up in the usual ElDoc buffer.
   • Nael does not offer any special mechanism to detect the current
     project.  Instead, it introduces Lakefiles as Project root markers.
   • Nael does not offer any special command to build the current
     project.  Instead, it configures the built-in ‘project-compile’
     command to work.
   • Nael does not offer any special input-method.  Instead, you may use
     the built-in ‘TeX’ input-method or the ‘unicode-math’ from the
     external unicode-math-input
     (https://github.com/astoff/unicode-math-input.el) package.
   • Nael does not solely use the Apache-2 license.  Instead, it is
     licensed partly under Apache-2, and partly under GPLv3+.
     Altogether, you can treat Nael as if it was under GPLv3+ since
     that's the stricter license.
